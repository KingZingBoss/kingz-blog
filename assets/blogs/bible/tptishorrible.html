            In recent years, many Christians have encountered The Passion Translation (TPT) Bible. Despite its growing
            popularity, there are several significant concerns regarding its accuracy and the claims made by its
            translator, Brian Simmons. Regardless of how appealing the translation might sound, it is crucial to
            remember our first commandment: to love God with all our heart, soul, and mind, as stated in Matthew 22:37
            (NASB2020): "And He said to him, ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your
            soul, and with all your mind.’" We must stay true to God's word, as God is not a respecter of persons,
            including Himself. Deuteronomy 18:22 (NASB2020) says, "When the prophet speaks in the name of the Lord, and
            the thing does not happen or come true, that is the thing which the Lord has not spoken. The prophet has
            spoken it presumptuously; you are not to be afraid of him."

                Translation by a Single Person

        </center>

        <p>
            A primary issue is that the TPT Bible was translated solely by Brian Simmons. Typically, Bible translations
            are carried out by teams of scholars from diverse backgrounds to ensure that the translation remains
            unbiased and accurate. This collaborative approach helps maintain the integrity of the original texts,
            something that is challenging to achieve with a single translator.

                Questionable Claims by Brian Simmons
            </h2>
        </center>

        <p>
            Brian Simmons has made several extraordinary claims about his translation work. He asserts that he received
            the correct version of the Bible directly from God and claims to have a supernatural understanding of Greek
            and Hebrew texts. Additionally, he mentions meeting an angel named "Passion," which inspired the name "The
            Passion Translation." Simmons has also stated that he received John chapter 23, which he has not yet
            released. Furthermore, he promotes courses that he claims are necessary for Christians to activate the gifts
            of the Spirit and asserts that Christians are everything Jesus ever is. These claims raise significant
            theological concerns.

            <h2>
                Inaccurate Translations
            </h2>
        </center>

        <p>
            Another critical issue is the inaccuracy of Simmons' translations. His interpretations often deviate
            alarmingly from traditional translations. For example, Song of Songs 4:4 is translated in a way that
            significantly alters its meaning. There are three main types of Bible translations: word-for-word,
            thought-for-thought, and paraphrase versions. Word-for-word translations, like NASB2020 and KJV, closely
            mimic the original texts. Thought-for-thought translations, such as the NIV, aim to convey the original
            thoughts more freely. Paraphrase versions, like the MSG, simplify the text for casual reading. The TPT
            claims to be a thought-for-thought translation, but it often adds words to suit specific beliefs, making it
            more of a sectarian text. This approach changes the tone and meaning of the original scriptures, which is
            problematic.
        </p>

        <p>
            For instance, in Song of Songs 4:4, the TPT translation reads,
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code class="language-plaintext">
                "When I look at you, I see your inner strength, so stately and strong. You are as secure as David’s fortress. Your virtues and grace cause a thousand famous soldiers to surrender to your beauty."
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            This is a stark contrast to other translations:
        </p>
        <pre>
                <code class="language-plaintext">
                    NIV: "Your neck is like the tower of David, built with courses of stone; on it hang a thousand shields, all of them shields of warriors."
                </code>
            </pre>

        <pre>
                <code class="language-plaintext">
                    KJV: "Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men."
                </code>
            </pre>

        <pre>
                <code class="language-plaintext">
                    NASB2020: "Your neck is like the tower of David, built with layers of stones on which are hung a thousand shields, all the round shields of the warriors."
                </code>
            </pre>

        <p>
            The TPT version not only adds words like "inner strength" and "beauty," which are not present in the
            original texts, but it also highlights these words in red, comparing them to the words of Jesus. This
            addition and alteration reflect Simmons' personal interpretations and beliefs rather than a faithful
            translation of the original scripture. It seems to express his inner selfishness and personal agenda, making
            the verse sound more like a modern, self-help affirmation rather than a biblical text.

                Financial Motives and Disputed Claims
            </h2>
        </center>

        <p>
            It appears that Brian Simmons is trying to solidify his extraneous beliefs by implanting them into the
            Bible. He is also attempting to make money by adding the need for his courses to the word of God and
            removing anything that opposes his views. Jerry McDaniels, a missionary and International Literacy
            Coordinator with Ethnos360/NTM, has indeed disputed Brian Simmons’ claims about his role in the Paya-Kuna
            New Testament translation. McDaniels asserts that Simmons was primarily a church planter and not a
            translator. According to McDaniels, Simmons’ involvement was limited to being a checker, where he provided
            feedback on the translation rather than directly translating the text. McDaniels also claims that Simmons
            attempted to insert his own beliefs into the translation, which led to conflicts and ultimately resulted in
            Simmons leaving the project. This perspective contrasts with Simmons’ own accounts of his contributions.

            <h2>
                Excessive Word Count
            </h2>
        </center>

        <p>
            Additionally, the TPT Bible has significantly more words than other translations. For example, Psalm 119 in
            the NASB2020 has 2,410 words, the NKJV has 2,417 words, and the NIV has 2,366 words. In contrast, the
            TPT has 3,193 words. This excessive addition of words is concerning and suggests an attempt to alter the
            original message. This is one of the reasons why Bible Gateway removed The Passion Translation from its list
            of available translations.

                Conclusion

        </center>

        <p>
            In conclusion, while The Passion Translation has gained a following, it is essential to approach it with
            caution. The concerns about its translation accuracy, the extraordinary claims made by Brian Simmons, and
            his lack of formal translatory experience all raise significant red flags. For those seeking a reliable and
            accurate Bible translation, it may be wise to consider other versions that have been translated by teams of
            scholars with diverse backgrounds. My advice is not to approach this translation at all.
